## 📱 First Time Usage

1. **Grant Camera Permissions**
   - When you first try to scan, your browser will ask for camera access
   - Click "Allow" to enable barcode scanning

2. **Create Your First Collection**
   - Click the "+ New Collection" button
   - Give it a name (e.g., "My Books", "To Read", "Sci-Fi Collection")
   - Click "Create"

3. **Add Your First Book**
   
   **Via Scanning (Recommended)**:
   - Open your collection
   - Click "📷 Scan Book"
   - Point your camera at the ISBN barcode on the back of a book
   - The app will automatically fetch book details

   **Via Manual Entry**:
   - Open your collection
   - Click "✏️ Add Manually"
   - Fill in the book details
   - Click "Add Book"

## 🔧 Development Mode

To work on the code with automatic recompilation:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch for TypeScript changes
npm run watch

# Terminal 2: Serve the application
npm run serve
```

Now any changes to `.ts` files will automatically recompile!

## 📚 What Can You Do?

### Collections
- ✅ Create unlimited collections
- ✅ Rename collections
- ✅ Delete collections
- ✅ View book count in each collection

### Books
- ✅ Scan ISBN barcodes to add books
- ✅ Manually add books without scanning
- ✅ View book covers, titles, authors, and publication info
- ✅ Delete books from collections
- ✅ All data stored locally (no account needed!)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Camera Access
- **HTTPS Required**: For camera access to work on non-localhost domains, you MUST use HTTPS
- **Permissions**: You must grant camera permissions when prompted
- **Mobile**: Works best with back camera on mobile devices

### Supported Barcodes
- ISBN-13 (13 digits)
- ISBN-10 (10 digits)
- EAN-13 barcodes

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Safari (iOS and macOS)
- ✅ Firefox
- ❌ Internet Explorer (not supported)

### Data Storage
- All data is stored in your browser's localStorage
- Data persists between sessions
- Clearing browser data will delete your collections
- No cloud backup (export feature coming soon)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Camera not working"
1. Check browser permissions (Settings → Privacy → Camera)
2. Make sure you're on HTTPS (or localhost)
3. Try a different browser
4. Check if camera works in other apps

### "Book not found"
1. Make sure the barcode is an ISBN (not another type of barcode)
2. Try better lighting conditions
3. Verify ISBN is correct
4. Use "Add Manually" as a fallback

### "Page won't load"
1. Check that you ran `npm run build`
2. Make sure you're serving the files (not just opening index.html as a file)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### "TypeScript errors"
1. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
2. Check `tsconfig.json` settings
3. Make sure you're using a recent version of TypeScript

## 📖 Next Steps

After getting familiar with the app:

1. Check `TODO.md` for planned features
2. Read `README.md` for full documentation
3. Explore the source code in `src/`
4. Suggest improvements or report bugs

---

## 🎯 Tips for Best Experience

1. **Good Lighting**: Scan barcodes in well-lit areas
2. **Steady Hand**: Hold your phone steady while scanning
3. **Right Distance**: Keep camera 4-6 inches from barcode
4. **Horizontal**: Hold barcode horizontally for best results
5. **Clean Lens**: Make sure your camera lens is clean

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Create collections by genre, reading status, or location
- Use manual entry for older books that may not be in Google Books
- The app works offline (but can't fetch book details without internet)
- You can use this on multiple devices, but data won't sync automatically
